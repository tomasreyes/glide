   *
   * <p>Multiple calls to this method append additional listeners. Previous listeners are not
   * removed. If you want to replace any previously added listeners, use {@link
   * #listener(RequestListener)}.
   *
   * <p>Listeners track the state of the request started by this particular {@code builder}. When
   * used with the thumbnail APIs ({@link #thumbnail(RequestBuilder)}) this can start to seem
   * confusing because multiple requests are running and each may succeed or fail, independent of
   * each other. As a rule, Glide does not add {@link RequestListener}s to thumbnail requests
   * automatically. That means that {@link RequestListener}s track the state of exactly one request
   * in the chain. For example, if you start a primary request with a single nested thumbnail and
   * you add a {@link RequestListener} only to the primary request, then the {@link RequestListener}
   * will only be notified when the primary request succeeds or fails. If the thumbnail succeeds,
   * but the primary request fails, the {@link RequestListener} added to the primary request will
   * still be called with {@link RequestListener#onLoadFailed(GlideException, Object, Target,
   * boolean)}. In the same scenario, the {@link RequestListener} added only to the primary request
   * will not have {@link RequestListener#onResourceReady(Object, Object, Target, DataSource,
   * boolean)} called when the thumbnail request finishes successfully. Similarly, if you add a
   * {@link RequestListener} only to a thumbnail request, but not the primary request, that {@code
   * listener} will only be called for changes related to the thumbnail request. If the thumbnail
   * request fails, the {@code listener} added to the thumbnail request will be immediately called
   * via {@link RequestListener#onLoadFailed(GlideException, Object, Target, boolean)}, even though
   * the primary request may eventually succeed. It is perfectly possible to add a {@link
   * RequestListener} to both the primary and a thumbnail request. If you do so, the {@link
   * RequestListener} will be called independently for each request when it finishes. Keep in mind
   * that if any parent request finishes before its thumbnail request(s), it will attempt to cancel
   * those requests. As a result there's no guarantee that a {@link RequestListener} added to a
   * thumbnail request will actually be called with either success or failure. These same patterns
   * hold for arbitrarily nested thumbnails. The {@code listener} is only called for the requests it
   * is added to and may not be called for every thumbnail request if those requests are cancelled
   * due to the completion of a parent request.
   *
   * <p>The one exception to the rules about thumbnails is {@link #thumbnail(float)}. In this case
   * we appear to be passing {@link RequestListener}s added to the parent request to the generated
   * thumbnail requests. To try to reduce confusion, the {@link #thumbnail(float)} method has been
   * deprecated. It can be easily replicated using {@link #thumbnail(RequestBuilder)} and {@link
   * BaseRequestOptions#sizeMultiplier(float)}.
   *
   * <p>Often in UIs it's desirable to try to track the overall status of a request, including the
   * thumbnails. For example, you might want to load an image, start an animation if the
   * asynchronous image load succeeds and perform some fallback action if it fails. If you're using
   * a single primary request, {@link RequestListener} will work for this. However, if you then
   * decide to try to make things more performant by adding a thumbnail (or multiple thumbnails),
   * {@link RequestListener} is awkward because either you only add it to the main request and it's
   * not called when the thumbnails complete (which defeats the purpose) or it's called for every
   * request and it's hard to keep track of when the overall request has failed. A better option
   * than using {@link RequestListener} to track the state of the UI then is to use {@link Target}
   * instead. {@link Target#onResourceReady(Object, Transition)} will be called when any thumbnail
   * finishes, which you can use to trigger your animation starting. {@link
   * Target#onLoadFailed(Drawable)} will only be called if every request in the chain, including the
   * primary request, fails, which you can use to trigger your fallback behavior. Be sure to pick an
   * appropriate {@link Target} subclass when possible, like {@link
   * com.bumptech.glide.request.target.BitmapImageViewTarget} or {@link
   * com.bumptech.glide.request.target.DrawableImageViewTarget} when loading into {@link ImageView}
   * or {@link com.bumptech.glide.request.target.CustomTarget} when using custom rendering. Don't
   * forget to call {@code super()} in the {@code ImageViewTarget}s.
   *
   * <p>It's best to create a single instance of an exception handler per type of request (usually
   * activity/fragment) rather than pass one in per request to avoid some redundant object
   * allocation.
   *
   * @param requestListener The request listener to use. If {@code null}, this method is a noop.
